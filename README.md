Projects to learn embedded systems development using Rasberry Pi Pico

I have taken an embedded systems course and done an internship, but I have never done eprsonal projects in embedded systems before these projects, and these are helping me
create my own embedded system applications from start to finish, learning about a variety of technologies and the process of applying them. The class was much too focused on particular hardware for the board itself and not exterior components/modules, and the board was not a generic arduino/pi board so it is useful to learn these things myself. Also, I want to create more advanced embedded systems in the future and learning to use the technologies I am able to obtain/afford seems useful, since my class and internship used microcontrollers far beyond my price limit. And the internship obviously focused on large slightly higher-level systems and not start-to-finish integration on microcontrollers.
